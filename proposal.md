# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: MFEM

MFEM is a c++ library for finite element methods. It includes features for arbitrarily high-order finite element meshes and spaces.
If offers a variety of finite element discritization approaches which can be scaled from laptops to GPU-accelerated supercomputers.
It's goal is to be a toolbox for FEM by providing the building blocks for developing algorithms. This makes the library a great option
for anyone from the university to industry level.
